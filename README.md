all_sensors_test_serial includes the data used to connect the shoe straight to serial and collect data that way.

all_sensors_test_ble is mostly the same code but instead also connects to BLE (uses a mostly adafruit example code for BLE connection with license still left at top)

central_ble is mostly just adafruit example code for the 'smart platform' microcontroller

master_scan is an I2C bus scan to see if all sensors are visible and available
